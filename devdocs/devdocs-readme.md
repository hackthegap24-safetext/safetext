# Safe Text Team Documentation

## Intro

This directory `./devdocs`, is for development team documentation, so we can record decisions and have a "Source of Truth" about why we have what we have.

## How To Use This Directory

Stuff that goes in here is anything and everything the dev team needs to know about the app.

This isn't an excuse to leave comments in code where they would be of the most use to others.

## Info That Is External To Git

If information is available via another source that can't be saved in Git, e.g. Figma, create a markdown document explaining what the info is and provide URL to get to the information. If outside sources require a user account, make sure folks know who to contact to get authorization to the project file.
